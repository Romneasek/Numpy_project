# Numpy_project
Let us build a complete project using NumPy (without any help).<br>
Path: project_data = 'KAG_Conversion_Data.csv'<br>
Features:<br>
1-ad_id: unique ID for each ad<br>
2-xyzcampaignid: an ID associated with each ad campaign of XYZ company<br>
3-fbcampaignid: an ID associated with how Facebook tracks each campaign<br>
4-age: age of the person to whom the ad is shown<br>
5-gender: gender of the person to whom the add is shown<br>
6-interest: a code specifying the category to which the person’s interest belongs (interests are as mentioned in the person’s Facebook public profile)<br>
7-Impressions: the number of times the ad was shown<br>
8-Clicks: number of clicks on for that ad<br>
9-Spent: Amount paid by company xyz to Facebook, to show that ad<br>
10-Total conversion: Total number of people who enquired about the product after seeing the ad<br>
11-Approved conversion: Total number of people who bought the product after seeing the ad<br>
Instructions:<br>
- Load the data. Data is already given to you in variable path

- How many unique ad campaigns (xyzcampaignid) does this data contain ? And for how many times was each campaign run ?

- What are the age groups that were targeted through these ad campaigns?

- What was the average, minimum and maximum amount spent on the ads?

- What is the id of the ad having the maximum number of clicks ?

- How many people bought the product after seeing the ad with most clicks? Is that the maximum number of purchases in this dataset?

- So the ad with the most clicks didn't fetch the maximum number of purchases. Find the details of the product having maximum number of purchases
